## Inspiration
Without a change in diet, it is very difficult to change weight or effectively build muscle, etc. So it would be helpful to have an app, that calculates the right amounts of the food you should eat.

## What it does
This app calculates the necessary daily intake of proteins, carbohydrates and more, based on your weight, age, height, etc. In addition, you can easily check off every day what you have already taken and what not and adjust your meals based on that. 

Due to time constraints, only this main function was implemented in the demo app. However, it is planned to add some more features that will make the way to the goal easier and motivate you.

On the one hand, the user should be able to save his own recipes in the 'Recipes' category. On the other hand, it should also be possible to find further recipes and inspirations with the help of an AI chatbot.

In the 'Journal' category, the user can enter small milestones on the way to the goal, such as "I have gained 5 kilos since the beginning. Only 3 more kilos to go!". This helps to motivate and stay on the ball.

The Mood Tracker is also designed to motivate. With the help of the tracker, the user can see how the change in the body and the new diet affect his mood. If the mood improves, it motivates the user to continue. If the mood gets worse, the user can make adjustments so that the journey remains pleasant.

We have added a few images of the app's initial design and the pages we have implemented.
